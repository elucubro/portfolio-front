The Transperth SmartRider was first introduced in 2001, making it one of the first smart cards in Australia. It has been a successful program, with over 1.3 million SmartRiders in circulation. However, the SmartRider is now starting to show its age.

One of the main issues with the SmartRider is that it uses old technology. The SmartRider cards are based on the Mifare Classic chip, which was first released in 1996. This chip is known to be vulnerable to security attacks, and there have been a number of reports of SmartRiders being hacked.

Another issue with the SmartRider is that it is not as convenient to use as newer smart cards. For example, the SmartRider cannot be used to pay for parking or access other facilities, such as the Perth Underground bike racks.

In addition to these issues, the SmartRider is also relatively slow. It can take several seconds for the SmartRider reader to recognize the card and process the payment. This can be frustrating for passengers, especially during peak times.

Despite these issues, the SmartRider is still a popular way to travel on Transperth services. However, it is clear that the SmartRider is in need of an upgrade.

Transperth is currently working on a new SmartRider system that is based on the latest technology. The new system is expected to be launched in 2024. The new SmartRider cards will be more secure, convenient, and faster than the existing cards. They will also include a number of new features, such as the ability to pay for parking and access other facilities.

The upgrade to the SmartRider system is a welcome development. It will make it easier and more convenient for people to use public transport in Perth. It will also help to improve the security of public transport services.

Here are some of the potential benefits of the new SmartRider system:

Improved security: The new SmartRider cards will be based on the latest security technology, making them more difficult to hack.
Increased convenience: The new SmartRider cards will be able to be used to pay for parking and access other facilities, making them more convenient to use.
Faster transaction times: The new SmartRider system will be faster than the existing system, which will reduce waiting times for passengers.
New features: The new SmartRider system will include a number of new features, such as the ability to track travel history and set up autoload.
Overall, the new SmartRider system is a significant improvement over the existing system. It is more secure, convenient, and faster. It also includes a number of new features that will make it easier for people to use public transport in Perth.port in Perth.
